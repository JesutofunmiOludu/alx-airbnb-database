## üß© Step 1: Baseline Query

A commonly used query retrieves confirmed bookings along with user and property details:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    u.full_name,
    p.title AS property_title
FROM bookings b
JOIN users u ON b.guest_id = u.user_id
JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed'
ORDER BY b.start_date DESC;
